# üöÄ AgenticEthereum-OnchainBuddy

Onchain Buddy is an AI assistant that helps beginners understand their blockchain activities. It analyzes transactions, explains them in simple terms, and guides users to learn about blockchain in a safe and proper way.

As your personal blockchain companion he acts as a real-time translator between complex blockchain operations and everyday language.

To making your first token swap or approving a new smart contract, it break down each action in clear and understandable explanations.

## üèó Architecture

The project is divided into three main components:

### Backend
- Handles user data persistence
- Manages XP and achievements system
- Provides API endpoints for frontend

### Agent
- Processes blockchain transactions
- Generates explanations using GPT-4
- Monitors wallet activity
- Assesses transaction risks

### Frontend
- User interface for wallet connection
- Displays transaction explanations
- Shows progression system
- Presents achievements
